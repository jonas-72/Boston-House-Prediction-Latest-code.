# Boston-House-Prediction-Latest-code.
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices in Boston, Massachusetts. The model was trained using a historical dataset, which is no longer available due to the removal of the Boston Housing Dataset from scikit-learn. 
 However, the general approach and techniques used in this project can be applied to similar datasets or real estate markets.

The Boston House Price Prediction model utilizes a supervised learning algorithm to analyze various features of a house and estimate its price. The dataset used in training the model consisted of information such as the number of rooms, crime rate, property tax, and other factors known to influence house prices. By analyzing these features, the model can make predictions about the price of a given property in Boston.
To use this model, you will need to provide information about the relevant features of a house, such as the number of rooms, crime rate in the neighborhood, and other characteristics. The model will then generate a predicted price based on the given input. It is important to remember that while the model can provide estimates, actual market conditions and other factors may influence the final price of a property.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different inputs to understand how the model functions. Additionally, you can adapt this project to incorporate alternative datasets or enhance the model's accuracy by applying advanced machine learning techniques.

Please note that this project is for educational and demonstration purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional real estate advice or market analysis.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Happy predicting!

Note: The original Boston Housing Dataset was removed from scikit-learn's official website.
